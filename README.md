    Cinder is a Dating Simulator in development. In Cinder, you are playing as a character named "Yuan"; Yuan is currently going through university along with his friend named Zack. One day, Zack bothered Yuan to download the dating app named Cinder. After creating his profile, Yuan didn't think much of the dating app and so, Yuan went on with his day and rested. After waking up from his rest, Yuan finds that his phone is spammed with matched profiles from the dating app... Then the story begins!
